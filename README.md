# 42Barcelona_02_ft_printf
The objective of this project is the reimplementation of the printf() function, providing an opportunity for developers to gain valuable experience in working with variable numbers of arguments.

## Implementation of the following conversions
**• '%c' Prints a single character.**

**• '%s' Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).**

**• '%p' The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.**

**• '%d' Prints a decimal (base 10) number.**

**• '%i' Prints an integer in base 10.**

**• '%u' Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.**

**• '%x' Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.**

**• '%X' Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.**

**• '%%' Prints a percent sign.**


### Requirements of the proyect

**• Don’t implement the buffer management of the original printf().**

**• Your function has to handle the following conversions: cspdiuxX%**

**• Your function will be compared against the original printf().**

**• You must use the command ar to create your library.**

**• Using the libtool command is forbidden.**

**• Your libftprintf.a has to be created at the root of your repository.**
